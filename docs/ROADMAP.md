# 🗺️ Roadmap
This project is a work in progress, and there’s still a lot to do. The roadmap highlights features I would like to add or refine to make ParlaChore more secure, observable, and joyful. It’s both a checklist and a vision statement — showing where the project is headed next.

### ✅ Completed Foundations
- Logging configuration with rotation and structured output
- Overlay swapper for seamless frontend updates
- Controller endpoints for secure partial rendering
- Dynamic configuration with YAML‑driven navigation rules
- SSL keystore automation for secure deployments

### 🚧 In Progress
- Documentation polish for recruiter‑friendly portfolio samples
- Theming system with declarative CSS variables and PostCSS optimization
- DTO management with Lombok & Jackson for clean serialization
- Chore Logic & Core Features 🧹



### 🌟 Would Like To
- Extend monitoring with health checks and Prometheus/Grafana integration
- Expand dynamic configuration to include feature flags and environment profiles
- Add role‑based access control (RBAC) using Kotlin enums
- Improve test coverage with JUnit, Mockito, and end‑to‑end UI flows
- Provide deployment profiles for dev/staging/prod with automated SSL provisioning
- Enrich documentation with onboarding guides and API references

🧹 Much of the actual “chore management” functionality is still to be built. The current focus has been on laying down the architectural foundations — configuration, theming, logging, and secure deployment — so that when the chore logic is implemented, it will sit on top of a stable, production‑ready base. I would like to expand this area with features such as chore assignment, approval workflows, progress tracking, and playful UX elements that bring the family‑focused vision of ParlaChore to life.
