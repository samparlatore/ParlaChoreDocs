ParlaChore is a **family chore and relationship app** that turns everyday routines into joyful, collaborative experiences.  
It combines **scalable backend engineering** with a **clean, mascot‑driven interface** so kids learn intuitive UI conventions, parents stay in control, and families celebrate progress together.

---

## ❓ Why ParlaChore?

- **Clean, intuitive UI** — Helps younger children learn standard computer/app conventions while keeping older kids frustration‑free with a streamlined flow.
- **Focus on family, not finance** — Rewards are tracked with *ParlaBucks*, a fun, symbolic system. Parents decide how those translate into real‑world recognition (screen time, outings, allowance).
- **Playful engagement** — Mascot‑driven themes, helpful tips, and a constructive feedback system turns chores into shared experiences rather than dull tasks.
- **Technical rigor** — Built with scalable backend architecture, secure account flows, and deployment readiness on AWS/Kubernetes.
- **Portfolio clarity** — Documentation demonstrates system design, security awareness, and DevOps practices alongside creative UX.

### Simple, Clean, Intuitive UI
- Designed to help **younger children** learn typical computer and app conventions in a safe, approachable way.
- A streamlined interface keeps **older children** focused — no clutter, no unnecessary steps.
- The goal: make it easy to log in, mark chores complete, and see rewards without frustration.

### Reward System: ParlaBucks
- ParlaChore uses a **virtual reward system** called *ParlaBucks*.
- ParlaBucks are **not real currency** — they’re a fun, symbolic way for kids to track progress and anticipate rewards.
- Parents decide how ParlaBucks translate into real‑world recognition, whether that’s extra screen time, a family outing, or even allowance.
- This keeps the app focused on **motivation and accountability**, while leaving financial decisions entirely up to families.

# ⚙️ Tech Stack & Control Flow

## Tech Stack Overview
- **Backend**
    - Spring Boot controllers expose RESTful endpoints for both **full-page shells** (SEO-friendly) and **AJAX partials** (dynamic overlays).
    - Layered architecture: DTOs, entities, repositories, and services with Lombok for reduced boilerplate.
    - Transparent debug logging and lifecycle checklists for collaborative troubleshooting.
- **Frontend**
    - Overlay swapper architecture with fade-in transitions for playful, emotionally resonant UX.
    - Progressive enhancement ensures crawlability even if JavaScript fails.
    - Utility classes and maintainable JS/CSS patterns keep the codebase future-proof.
- **SEO & Accessibility**
    - Controller mappings ensure crawlers see complete shells.
    - Semantic HTML and ARIA roles for inclusive design.
    - Declarative UI structure supports both human readability and machine parsing.

## 🔄 Request → Response → Swapper → Animation Lifecycle

| Step              | Trigger/Event                  | Backend Response                  | Frontend Action                          | Outcome                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **1. Initial Load** | Browser requests route         | Full HTML shell (SEO tags, metadata, placeholders) | Render shell, preload assets              | Crawlable, complete page         |
| **2. User Action**  | Click / navigation / overlay   | AJAX request sent to `/partials/` | Overlay swapper listens and intercepts    | Request lifecycle begins         |
| **3. Partial Fetch**| AJAX request received          | Lean fragment (no scaffolding)    | Swapper replaces target overlay           | Content updated dynamically      |
| **4. Transition**   | Fragment injected              | —                                 | Fade-in animation applied                 | Playful, emotionally resonant UX |
| **5. Debug Log**    | Lifecycle events (req/res/render/anim) | Transparent logs written to `/logs/` | Debug flags toggle visibility             | Collaborative troubleshooting    |
| **6. Fallbacks**    | JS disabled or error           | Full shell served                 | Browser displays complete page            | Resilient, SEO-friendly recovery |

## 🧱 Architecture & Design

### Domain Modeling
- `Account` entity with secure hashed credentials and verification flow.
- `User` entity with `PARENT` and `CHILD` roles (via `Role` enum).
- Planned: `Chore`, `ChoreTemplate`, `ChoreInstance`, `WeeklySchedule`.

### Config-Driven Setup
- `application.yml` for environment-specific settings.
- Externalized Kafka, DB, and service wiring.

### Secure Account Flow
- Email verification, hashed passwords, role-based access.
- Planned: Invite tokens, parent sign-off, and audit logging.

---

## 🧪 Testing & DevOps
- **Spring Boot Test** — Unit and integration testing.
- **Maven + Surefire Plugin** — Build and test automation.
- **Docker-Ready** — Modular services designed for containerization.
- **Kubernetes-Ready** — Stateless services, external config, and health endpoints planned.

---

## 🎨 Theme Families (Condensed)
ParlaChore supports multiple theme families for playful customization:
- **Classic** (default) — muted blues and grays.
- **Undersea** — aqua, teal, coral.
- **Outer Space** — midnight blue, cosmic purple.
- **Airport, Build Site, Race Track, Stables, Fairy Forest, Dragon Cliffs, Cat’s Den, Dog Pen** — each with unique palettes and mascot-driven backgrounds.

Themes are stored under `/resources/static/images/themes/` with avatars and backgrounds organized by family.
